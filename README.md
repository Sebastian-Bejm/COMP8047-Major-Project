# COMP8047-Major-Project

For COMP 8047 Major Project course

This project was an attempt to implement a machine learning algorithm as an application of real-time pathfinding in a simple game based on navigating randomly generated mazes with obstacles. 
The initial aim of this project was to implement the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm from a research paper, but was eventually changed to implement the Q-Learning algorithm in place of it.
